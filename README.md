My name is Max Crane and I am a 3rd year student studying Software Engineering at Cal Poly.

# CommandLineScore
This program is intended to run on the command line of any machine and is to be able to edit a musical score, convert it to a MIDI file and play it. Currently it only works on Mac, but my intention is to get it to work on any almost any modern machine.
In order to edit the score, the user must also type in commands via a text menu which could be made more simple. Eventually I may isolate the model of this program and build a simpler interface for it.
